#eventFull website

This web interface is created as a ticketing event marketplace for buyers and sellers to interact. 

I used Python with Flask to code this website using localhost. Then styled the website using HTML, CSS, JS. 
There are a lot of functionalities that I made for this ticketing marketplace. 
- Login, Logout functionalities
- Sign up for an account
- Purchasing tickets function
- Listing tickets function
- Liking events
- Delete event listed
